<h1 align="center">Welcome to my profile, I'm Edoardo Ilas</h1>

<p>Hello there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px" height="20px"> My name is Edoardo and I enjoy developing Android applications. My interest started in 2019, when someone asked me if I was able to make an application for them that didn't exist at the time. Today, my goal is to improve my experience and share open-source applications on the internet. I've also tried other stuff, such as Web Design, Web Development, Game Development, Arduino, and more.</p>
